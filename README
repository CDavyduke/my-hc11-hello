		Hello World Tutorial


    This example is a simple hello program that prints "Hello World!"
    on the 68HC11 serial line.  It is self contained by the fact that
    it does not use any include, Makefile or configuration file of GEL.

    To compile this program, you can use the following command:

        m6811-elf-gcc -g -Os -mshort -Wl,-m,m68hc11elfb -o hello.elf hello.c

    This will produce the `hello.elf' file.  This file in a binary file
    in the ELF/DWARF-2 standard format.  It contains the 68HC11 binary
    code, the symbols and the debugging information suitable for gdb.
    To obtain the S19 file corresponding to the program, you can use
    the following command:

        m6811-elf-objcopy --only-section=.text --only-section=.rodata \
                          --only-section=.vectors --only-section=.data \
                          --output-target=srec hello.elf hello.s19

    and this will produce `hello.s19' file in Motorola S19 format.

    Note:  You can also use the Makefile and type:

        make

    To run or test this program, you can use the simulator or gdb:

    m6811-elf-run hello.elf

    or

    m6811-elf-gdb hello.elf
    (gdb) target sim
    (gdb) load
    (gdb) run

    From the debugger you can execute step by step the program if you
    do the following:

    (gdb) target sim
    (gdb) load
    (gdb) b main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x6e: file hello.c, line 166.
    (gdb) run
    ...
    (gdb) next
    ...
